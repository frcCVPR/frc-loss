# Denoising images with Fourier Ring Correlation loss #

The python code accompanies the manuscript _Image quality measurements and denoising using Fourier Ring Correlations_ submitted to CVPR 2022. The main code is used for training denoising networks.

In the **notebooks** folder all the images shown in the manuscript are generated using jupyter notebooks. 
The data and network models used in the notebooks are deposited in [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/record/5831014#.YdnW_VjMLeo)

Examples of training FRC networks, and additional processing with FRC will be added soon.
